# Animal Images Classification with PyTorch

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook focused on building an animal image classification model using PyTorch. The goal of this project is to train a deep learning model to accurately categorize images into various animal classes.

## Overview

The notebook follows a systematic approach to achieve the classification task:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset is loaded and preprocessed. This includes tasks like resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and applying data augmentation techniques to enhance the model's generalization.

2. **Model Architecture:** A convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is defined using PyTorch's `nn.Module`. This network is designed to extract features from the input images.

3. **Training and Validation:** The model is trained using labeled data, and both training and validation losses are monitored. Backpropagation is employed to optimize the model's parameters.

4. **Evaluation:** The model's performance is assessed on a separate validation dataset to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.

5. **Testing:** The trained model is applied to a test dataset to measure its real-world performance.

6. **Results and Analysis:** Classification results are presented, potentially with visualizations. Insights may be drawn about the model's effectiveness.

## Dependencies

The notebook relies on the following Python libraries:
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook `animal_image_classification.ipynb`.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the notebook.
3. Execute the cells sequentially to load data, define the model, train, validate, and test it.
